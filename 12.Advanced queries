Advanced queries
	Native SQL can be executed using .createNativeQuery(query, class). It returns untyped Query object, not TypedQuery
	@NativeNamedQuery(name, query, resultClass) can be defined on the entitties. Can return TypedQuery
	Entities, read by native SQL become managed, so any change will be saved to the database. 
		If not all the fields were read by the querry, they will default to null and will overwrite the database values when transaction commits, so read everything
	Executing navtive SQL to modify data is discouraged, the provider cannot track the changes
	@SqlResultSetMapping(name, entities) can be places on an entity to define specific mapping of the native query
	Single-valued relationships are mapped correctly with native query, but there is no way to populate collections
